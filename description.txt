 Denoising Monte Carlo rendering with a very low sample rate remains a major challenge in the photo-realistic rendering research. Many previous works, including regression-based methods and learning-based methods, have been explored to achieve better rendering quality with less computational cost. However, most of these methods rely on hand-crafted optimization objectives, hence are not able to properly model humanâ€™s visual perception. This has led to artifacts such as blurs or unfaithful details. In this paper, we present an adversarial approach for denoising Monte Carlo rendering. Our key insight is that generative adversarial networks can help denoiser networks to better produce realistic high-frequency details and global illumination by learning the distribution from a set of high quality Monte Carlo path tracing images. We also adapt a novel feature modulation method to better utilize auxiliary features, such as normal, albedo and depth, in the network. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, our approach produces better reconstruction of the Monte Carlo integral from a few samples, performs more robustly at different sample rates, and only consumes milliseconds for images with megapixels.
